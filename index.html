            <p>My name is Antonio J. Gage, and I'm a software developer at HP. In my spare time I enjoy being engulfed in fitness, both training myself and others. I actively practice many martial arts and enjoy hiking, sky diving, surfing, and generally anything technologically related. I'm originally from Houston, Texas; however, I've been living in Austin for 3 years.</p>
